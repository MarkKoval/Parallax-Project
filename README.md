# Parallax Project

This project is a demonstration of parallax scrolling effect using HTML, CSS, and the Parallax.js library. Parallax scrolling creates an engaging visual effect by moving different layers of content at different speeds, giving the illusion of depth and immersion.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the project files.
2. Ensure you have the latest version of a modern web browser installed (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
3. Open the project folder and navigate to the `index.html` file.
4. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Dependencies

This project utilizes the following dependencies:

- [Parallax.js](https://github.com/wagerfield/parallax) - A lightweight and easy-to-use parallax scrolling effect library.

The necessary CSS and JavaScript files for Parallax.js are included in the project repository, so you don't need to download them separately.

## Usage

Once you have the project running in your web browser, you can scroll through the page to experience the parallax scrolling effect. The different layers of content will move at different speeds, creating a visually captivating experience.

You can customize the project by modifying the HTML and CSS files according to your requirements. The parallax effect is achieved by assigning appropriate CSS classes and data attributes to the HTML elements.
